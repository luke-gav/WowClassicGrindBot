# Master Of Puppets

The project current goal is to support `Season of Mastery Classic`, `Burning Crusade Classic`, `Wrath of the Lich King Classic`

# Components

- **Addon**: Modified [Happy-Pixels](https://github.com/FreeHongKongMMO/Happy-Pixels) to read the game state.
- **Frontend**: [ASP.NET Core Razor components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/).
- **BlazorServer**: [ASP.NET Core Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor) to show the state in a browser.
- **HeadlessServer**: Run from CommandLine without Frontend. Requires valid configuration files present next to the executable.
- Backend(**Core/Game**): written in C#. Screen capture, mouse and keyboard clicking. No memory tampering and DLL injection.

# Architecture

Further detail about the architecture can be found in [Blog post](http://www.codesin.net/post/wowbot/).

# Pathfinders

* World map - Outdoor there are multiple solutions - *by default the app attempts to discover the available services in the following order*:
    * **V3 Remote**: Out of process [AmeisenNavigation](https://github.com/Xian55/AmeisenNavigation/tree/feature/multi-version-guess-z-coord)
    * **V1 Remote**: Out of process [PathingAPI](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/tree/dev/PathingAPI) more info [here](#v1-remote-pathing---pathingapi)
    * **V1 Local**: In process [PPather](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/tree/dev/PPather)
* World map - Indoors pathfinder only works properly if `PathFilename` is exists.
* Dungeons / instances **not** supported!

# Supporting Cataclysm Classic limitations

With Cataclysm, the navigation will be limited. Only V3 Remote will be support for now.

V1 Local and V1 Remote does not have the capability as of this moment to read the CASC files only works with MPQs.

# Features

# Issues and Ideas

Create an issue with the given template.

# Contribute

You are welcome to create pull requests. Some ideas of things that could be improved:

* This readme
* More route and class profiles
* Feel free to ask questions by opening new issues

# Getting it working

## 1. Download this repository

Put the contents of the repo into a folder, e.g., `C:\WowClassicGrindBot`. I am going to refer to this folder from now on, so just substitute your folder path.

## 2.1 Using V1 Local/Remote Pathing

- Download the MPQ route files.
- These files are required to start the application!

**Vanilla:**
[**common-2.MPQ**](https://mega.nz/file/vXQCBCha#m7COhB9HQd86a5iNAT0-fMLsc-BtoTRO1eIBJNrdTH8) (1.7Gb)

**TBC:**
[**expansion.MPQ**](https://mega.nz/file/Of4i2YQS#egDGj-SXi9RigG-_8kPITihFsLom2L1IFF-ltnB3wmU) (1.8Gb)

**WOTLK:**
[**lichking.MPQ**](https://mega.nz/file/vDYWSTrK#fvaiuHpd-FTVsQT4ghGLK6QJLZyA87c1rlBEeu1_Btk) (2.5Gb)

Copy these files under the **\Json\MPQ** folder (e.g., `C:\WowClassicGrindBot\Json\MPQ`)

Technical details about **V1:**
- Precompiled x86 and x64 [Stormlib](https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/StormLib)
- Source code accessible, written in **C#**
- Uses `*.mpq` files as source
- Extracts the geometry on demand during runtime
- Loads those `*.adt` files which are in use. Lower memory usage compared to V3
- After calculating a path successfully, caches it under `Json\PathInfo\_CONTINENT_NAME_\`
- Easy to visualize path steps and development iteratively

## 2.2 Optional - Using V3 Remote Pathing

Since [PR 585](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/issues/585) using a different branch!

- Download the navmesh files.

[**Vanilla + TBC**](https://mega.nz/file/7HgkHIyA#c_gzUeTadecWY0JDY3KT39ktfPGLs2vzt_90bMvhszk)

[**Vanilla + TBC + Wrath**](https://mega.nz/file/zWQ2XIKI#9EKWOPyyTMfY1LACkcP_wioZ0poVIuaGh2xcRh4V9dw)

[**Vanilla + TBC + Wrath + Cataclysm** - work in progress](https://mega.nz/file/7Og32TDA#5HpxZ8Sh1XvDNCmWbI8H-cOFEJzDmh97Z6FGrO2p3X4)

1. Extract the `mmaps` and copy anywhere you want, like `C:\mmaps`
1. Get the [multi-version-guess-z-coord branch](https://github.com/Xian55/AmeisenNavigation/tree/feature/multi-version-guess-z-coord)
1. Open the solution file.
1. Unload **AmeisenNavigation.Exporter** project(right click -> unload project)
1. ![image](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/assets/367101/df443648-bb57-4200-ac99-ee26e723f120)
1. Select **AmeisenNavigation.Server** Press rebuild.
1. Navigate to the `AmeisenNavigation.Server` build(ex. `AmeisenNavigation.Server\build\x64\Release`) location and find `config.cfg`
1. Edit the last line of the file to look like `sMmapsPath=C:\mmaps`
1. Start `AmeisenNavigation.Server.exe`

Technical details about **V3:**
- Uses another project called [AmeisenNavigation](https://github.com/Xian55/AmeisenNavigation/tree/feature/multi-version-guess-z-coord)
- Under the hood uses [Recast and Detour](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation)
- Source code is written in **C++**
- Uses `*.mmap` files as source
- Loads the whole continent navmesh data into memory. Higher base memory usage, at least around *~600mb*
- It's super fast path calculations
- Not always suitable for player movement.
- Requires a considerable amount of time to tweak the navmesh config, then bake it

## 3.1 System / Video Requirements

Tested resolutions with either full screen or windowed:
* 1024 x 768
* 1920 x 1080
* 3440 x 1440
* 3840 x 2160

For Nvidia users, under Nvidia Control panel settings
* Make sure the `Image Sharpening` under the `Manage 3D Settings`-> Global settings or Program Settings(for WoW) is set to `Sharpening Off, Scaling disabled`!

Known issues with other applications:
* `f.lux` can affect final image color on the screen thus prevents NpcNameFinder to work properly.

## 3.2 In-game Requirements

Required game client settings. Press `ESC` -> `System`
  * System > Graphics > Anti-Aliasing: `None`
  * System > Graphics > Vertical Sync: `Disabled`
  * System > Advanced > Contrast: `50`
  * System > Advanced > Brightness: `50`
  * System > Advanced > Gamma from: `1.0`
  * System > Render Scale: `100%`
  * Disable Glow effect - type in the chat `/console ffxGlow 0`
  * To keep/save this settings make sure to properly shutdown the game.

## 3.3 Optional - Replace default game Font

Highly recommended to replace the default in-game font with a much **Bolder** one with [this guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/changing-wow-text-font)

Should be only concerned about `Friz Quadrata: the "Everything Else" Font` which is the `FRIZQT__.ttf` named file.

Example - [Robot-Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?thickness=5) - Shows big improvement to the `NpcNameFinder` component which is responsible to find - friendly, enemy, corpse - names above NPCs head.

## 3.4 Optional - Enable Minimum Character Name Size

In the modern client under ESC > Options > Accessibility > General > **Minimum Character Name Size = 6**

This feature sets a minimum size of the character/npc names above their head.

However it has one downside, there's distance based alpha blending. It could cause issues with Corpse names.

More info [506](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/pull/506)

## 4.1 Build Requirements

* Windows 10 and above
* [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
* `AnyCPU`, `x86` and `x64` build supported.

## 4.2 Build the solution

One of the following IDE or command line
* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code
* Powershell

e.g. Build from Powershell
```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot
dotnet build -c Release
```

![Build](images/build.png)

## 5. BlazorServer Configuration process

The app reads the game state using small blocks of color shown at the top of the screen by an Addon. This needs to be configured.

1. Edit the batch script in `C:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer` called `run.bat`, change it to point at where you have put the repo BlazorServer folder

    e.g.
    ```ps
    start "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "http://192.168.0.19:5000"
    c:
    cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer
    dotnet run -c Release
    pause
    ```

2. Execute the `run.bat`. This will start the bot and Chrome, WoW client must be already running. 

2. If you get `"Unable to find the Wow process is it running ?"` in the console window then it can't find game executable.

4. When running the BlazorServer for the first time you will have to follow a setup process:
    * Start the game and login with a character
    * Navigate to `2. Addon Configuration`
    * Fill the `Author` input form
    * Fill the `Title` input form
    * Then press `Save` button -> Log should see `AddonConfigurator.Install successful`
    * Should see a loading screen
    * At the top left corner of the game window should see flashing pixels / cells
    * Navigate to `5. Frame Configuration` [Guidance for good DataFrame](../../wiki/Guidance-for-good-DataFrame)
    * Click on `Auto` -> `Start` [Validate FrameConfiguration](../../wiki/Validating-FrameConfiguration)

5. Addon Control panel `Status` is `Update Available`
    * Press `Save` button
    * Should see a loading screen
    * Restart the BlazorServer
    * Complete `5. Frame Configuration` steps again
    * Click on `Auto` -> `Start` [Validate FrameConfiguration](../../wiki/Validating-FrameConfiguration)

## 6. BlazorServer should restart and show the dashboard page.

## 7 Optional - Running HeadlessServer

Similar to BlazorServer project, except without Frontend. Should consume less system resources in general.

While the bot is running there's no way to adjust / tweak the values. In order to take effect, have to restart.

Everything has to be setup inside the [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration) file, in prior.

A successful [Configuration process](#5-blazorserver-configuration-process) has a result of a following configuration files
* `data_config.json`
* `addon_config.json`
* `frame_config.json`

To see how to first time run the `HeadlessServer` please look at `HeadlessServer\install.bat`.

A few use case when you need to run `install.bat`
* After the first project download
* After git project clone
* After downloading a new version of the project
* After made a change in the source code which result a new Addon Version
* After switched from **FullScreen** to **Windowed mode** thus a `frame_config.json` needed to be recreated

For normal quick startup of `HeadlessServer` please look at the `HeadlessServer\run.bat`.

**Required** cli parameter: relative [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration) file name under the [/Json/class/](./Json/class) folder.

**Optional** cli parameters:

| cli | Description | Default Value | Possible Values |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `-m`<br>`-mode` | Pathfinder type | `RemoteV3` | `Local` or `RemoteV1` or `RemoteV3` |
| `-p`<br>`-pid` | World of Warcraft process id | `-1` | open up task manager to find PID |
| `-r`<br>`-reader` | Addon data screen reader backend | `DXGI` | `DXGI` works since Win8 |
| `hostv1` | Navigation Remote V1 host | `192.168.0.19` | - |
| `portv1` | Navigation Remote V1 port | `5001` | - |
| `hostv3` | Navigation Remote V3 host | `192.168.0.19` | - |
| `portv3` | Navigation Remote V3 port | `47111` | - |
| `-n`<br>`-viz` | While Remote V1 is available, show Path Visualization<br>Can display Remote V3 Paths as well. | `false` | - |
| `-d`<br>`-diag` | Diagnostics, when set, takes screen captures under `Json\cap\*.jpg` | - | - |
| `-o`<br>`-overlay` | Show NpcNameFinder Overlay | `false` | - |
| `-t`<br>`-otargeting` | While overlay enabled, show Targeting points | `false` | - |
| `-s`<br>`-oskinning` | While overlay enabled, show Skinning points | `false` | - |
| `-v`<br>`-otargetvsadd` | While overlay enabled, show Target vs Add points | `false` | - |
| `--loadonly` | Loads the given class profile then exits | `false` | - |

e.g. run from Powershell without any optional parameter
```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\HeadlessServer
.\run.bat Hunter_1.json
```

e.g. run from Powershell optional parameters, using `DXGI` reader and forced `Local` pathfinder.
```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\HeadlessServer
.\run.bat Hunter_1.json -m Local
```

e.g. run from Powershell optional parameters, only loads the profile then exits a good indicator that your profile can be loaded
```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\HeadlessServer
.\run.bat Hunter_1.json -m Local --loadonly
```

## 8. Configure the Wow Client - Interface Options

Need to make sure that certain interface options are set.

The most important are `Click-to-Move` and `Do Not Flash Screen at Low Health`.

From the main menu (ESC) set the following under Interface Options:

| Interface Option | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| Controls - Enable Interact Key | **true** |
| Controls - Auto Loot | &#9745; |
| Controls - Interact on Left click | &#9744; |
| Combat - Do Not Flash Screen at Low Health | &#9745; |
| Combat - Auto Self Cast | &#9745; |
| Names - NPC Names | &#9745; |
| Names - Enemy Units (V) | &#9744; |
| Camera - Auto-Follow Speed | **Fast** |
| Camera - Camera Following Style | **Always** |
| Mouse - Click-to-Move | &#9745; |
| Mouse - Click-to-Move Camera Style | **Always** |
| Accessibility - Cursor Size | **32x32** |
| Accessibility - Minimum Character Name Size | Recommended value is **6**. |

## 9. Configure the Wow Client - Key Bindings

From the main menu (ESC) -> `Key Bindings` set the following:

`Movement Keys`:

| In-Game | ClassConfiguration Name | Default [ConsoleKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.consolekey) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Move Forward | ForwardKey | `UpArrow` |
| Move Backward | BackwardKey | `DownArrow` |
| Turn Left | TurnLeftKey | `LeftArrow` |
| Turn Right | TurnRightKey | `RightArrow` |
| Jump | Jump.Key | `Spacebar` |
| Sit/Move down | StandUp.Key | `X` |

To change the default movement keys from arrows to `WASD` in the [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration) file or look at the example `Json\class\Warrior_1_MovementKeys.json`
```json
"ForwardKey": 87,   // W
"BackwardKey": 83,  // S
"TurnLeftKey": 65,  // A
"TurnRightKey": 68, // D
```

`Targeting`:

| In-Game | HotKey | ClassConfiguration KeyAction | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Target Nearest Enemy | `Tab` | TargetNearestTarget | ---- |
| Target Pet | `Multiply` | TargetPet | Only pet based class |
| Target Last Target | `G` | TargetLastTarget | Loot last target |
| Interact With Mouseover | `J` | InteractMouseOver | Mouse based actions |
| Interact With Target | `I` | Interact | Targeting and combat |
| Assist Target | `F` | TargetTargetOfTarget | ---- |
| Pet attack | `Subtract` | PetAttack | Only pet based class |
| Target Focus | `PageUp` | TargetFocus | TBC or Wrath version, `"AssistFocus"` Mode |
| Target Party Member 1 | `PageUp` | TargetFocus | Vanilla version, `"AssistFocus"` Mode |

## 10.1. Actionbar Key Bindings:

The default class profiles assumes the following `Keybinds` setup while using **English Keyboard** layout.

In total, `34` customizable key can be configured.

Highly recommended to use the default setup, in order to get properly working the `ActionBarSlotCost` and `ActionBarSlotUsable` features!

| Actionbar |ActionSlot | Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main | 1-12 | 1,2,3 .. 9,0,-,= | 0 is the 10th key. |
| Bottom Right | 49-58 | N1,N2,N3 .. N9,N0 | N means Numpad 0 is the 10th key |
| Bottom Left | 61-72 | F1,F2,F3 .. F11,F12 | F means Functions |

   <img alt="Screenshot" src="./images/keybindings.png" width="75%">
</a>

## 11. Configure the Wow Client - Bindpad addon

Bindpad allows keys to be easily bound to commands and macros. Type `/bindpad` to show it.

For each of the following click + to add a new key binding.

|  Key |  Command | Note |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Delete | /stopattack<br>/stopcasting<br>/petfollow | ---- |
| Insert | /cleartarget | ---- |
| PageDown | /follow | Only for `"AssistFocus"` Mode |

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="./images/bindpad_stopattack.png" target="_blank">
                <img alt="bindpad_stopattack" src="./images/bindpad_stopattack.png" width="100%">
            </a>
        </td>
        <td>
            <a href="./images/bindpad_cleartarget.png" target="_blank">
                <img alt="bindpad_cleartarget" src="./images/bindpad_cleartarget.png" width="100%">
            </a>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## 12. Class Configuration

If one of the Property is not explicitly mentioned during the configuration or in the examples, you can assume it uses the default value!

Each class has a configuration file in [/Json/class/](./Json/class) e.g. the config for a `Warrior` it is in file [Warrior_1.json](./Json/class/Warrior_1.json).

The configuration file determines what spells the character casts, when pulling and in combat, where to vendor and repair and what buffs consider.

Take a look at the class files in [/Json/class/](./Json/class) for examples of what you can do.

Your class file probably exists and just needs to be edited to set the pathing file name.

| --- |
| Normal |
| Trivial |
| Minus |
| Rare |
| Elite |
| RareElite |
| WorldBoss |

The mentioned values can be combined together like:

e.g.
```json
"TargetMask": "Normal, Trivial, Rare, Elite, RareElite",    // multiple combined
```

Where `Elite` and `RareElite` has been included compare to default.

### NpcSchoolImmunity

| SchoolMask |
| --- |
| None |
| Physical |
| Holy |
| Fire |
| Nature |
| Frost |
| Shadow |
| Arcane |

Defined as KeyValuePair where the key is the NPC Id and the value is the type of `SchoolMask` type is immune against.

The mentioned values can be combined together like:

e.g.
```json
"NpcSchoolImmunity": {
    "1043": "Shadow",                   // single
    "9026": "Fire",
    "1668": "Fire, Shadow, Arcane"      // multiple combined
}
```

### KeyboardOnly

By Default, the bot attempts to use the mouse for the following reasons:
* `Follow Route Goal` Targeting non blacklisted npcs
* `Loot Goal` and `Skinning Goal` while acquiring target

You can disable this behavior by setting `KeyboardOnly` to `true` in the [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration). Which has the following effects:
* `Loot` limited, only capable of looting by selecting last target. So after each killed mob only the **last npc** can be looted.
* GatherCorpse(`Skin`, `Herb`, `Mine`, `Salvage`) unavailable.
* Target selection limited to only `TargetNearestTargetKey`, which significantly reduce how quickly can find the next target.

### IntVariables

Gives the ability to the user to define global integer variables along the whole [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration) scope. 

For example look at the Warlock profiles.
```json
"IntVariables": {
    "DOT_MIN_HEALTH%": 35,
    "Debuff_Frost Fever": 237522,   // iconId https://www.wowhead.com/icons
    "Debuff_Blood Plague": 237514,  // iconId https://www.wowhead.com/icons
    "Item_Soul_Shard": 6265,
}
```

### Path

The path that the player follows during [Follow Route Goal](#follow-route-goal), its a `json` file under [/Json/path/](./Json/path) which contains a list of `x`,`y`,`z` coordinates while looking for mobs.

### PathSettings

| Property Name | Description | Optional | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"PathFilename"` | [Path](#path) to use while alive | **false** | `""` |
| `"PathThereAndBack"` | While using the path, [should go start to and reverse](#there-and-back) | true | `true` |
| `"PathReduceSteps"` | Reduce the number of path points | true | `false` |

### Simple approach

When the bellow properties are defined in the [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration), a new [PathSettings](#pathsettings) instance is created under in `Paths` array as the first element.

```json
"PathFilename": "_pack\\1-20\\Dwarf.Gnome\\1-4_Dun Morogh.json.json",   // the path to walk when alive
"PathThereAndBack": true,                                               // if true walks the path and the walks it backwards.
"PathReduceSteps": true,                                                // uses every other coordinate, halve the coordinate count
```

I keep the previously mentioned properties for backward compatibility and also if you not interested in changing path during runtime.

Example can be found under [Warrior_1.json](./Json/class/Warrior_1.json).

### Multiple Paths with Requirements

With the latest update it is possible to change between multiple paths during runtime.

In that case properties what mentioned in [Simple approach](#simple-approach) are ignored.

Instead using another structure called [Class Configuration.Paths](#12-class-configuration) array, which is very similar, however theres are addition [Requirements](#requirement) field. Backed by [PathSettings](#pathsettings) object.

Let's look at the following example
- It is really important to always have one `Path` which doesn't have any condition, serves as fallback.
- 3 paths defined here. 2 with conditions and 1 with fallback(no requirements which means it can always run)
- The definition order matters, the first element has the highest priority, while the last element in the array has the lowest.
- Each path is added as a new [Follow Route Goal](#follow-route-goal) with a custom cost. The base cost is 20, and its auto incremented by `0.1f`. So you can even add your own logic in between the goals.
- Each [Follow Route Goal](#follow-route-goal) component preserves it state from the last execution time.
- It can accept [Requirements](#requirement) as condition.

```json
"Paths": [
{
    "PathFilename": "1-5_Gnome.json",                                 // Only runs when the player is below level 4 
    "PathThereAndBack": false,
    "PathReduceSteps": false,
    "Requirements": [
        "Level < 4"
    ]
},
{
    "PathFilename": "_pack\\1-20\\Dwarf.Gnome\\1-4_Dun Morogh.json",  // Only runs when the player is at least level 4 but below level 5
    "Requirements": [
        "Level < 5"
    ]
},
{
    "PathFilename": "_pack\\1-20\\Dwarf.Gnome\\4-6_Dun Morogh.json",  // Runs when the player is at least level 5
    "PathThereAndBack": false,
    "PathReduceSteps": false
}
],
```

The previously mentioned example can be found under [Hunter_1.json](./Json/class/Hunter_1.json).

### KeyActions

Its a container type for `Sequence` of [KeyAction](#keyaction).

### KeyAction

Each `KeyAction` has its own properties to describe what the action is all about. 

Can specify conditions with [Requirement(s)](#requirement) in order to create a matching action for the situation.

| Property Name | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"Name"` | Name of the KeyAction. For the `ActionBarPopulator`, lowercase means macro. | `""` |
| `"Key"` | [ConsoleKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.consolekey) to press | `""` |
| `"Cost"` | [Adhoc Goals](#adhoc-goals) or [NPC Goal](#npc-goals) only, priority | `18` |
| `"PathFilename"` | [NPC Goal](#npc-goals) only, this is a short path to get close to the NPC to avoid walls etc. | `""` |
| `"HasCastBar"` | After key press cast bar is expected?<br>By default sets `BeforeCastStop`=`true` | `false` |

| `"BeforeCastDelay"` | Delay in milliseconds. | `0` |
| `"BeforeCastMaxDelay"` | Max delay in milliseconds.<br>If set then using random delay between [`BeforeCastDelay`..`BeforeCastMaxDelay`] | `0` |
| `"BeforeCastStop"` | Stop moving. | `false` |
| `"BeforeCastDismount"` | Should dismount. [Adhoc Goals](#adhoc-goals) only. | `true` |
| --- | After Successful cast, ... | --- |
| `"AfterCastWaitSwing"` | Wait for next melee swing to land.<br>Blocks **CastingHandler**. | `false` |
| `"AfterCastWaitCastbar"` | Wait for the castbar to finish, `SpellQueueTimeMs` excluded.<br>Blocks **CastingHandler**. | `false` |

| `"AfterCastDelay"` | delay in milliseconds.<br>Blocks **CastingHandler**. | `0` |
| `"AfterCastMaxDelay"` | delay in milliseconds.<br>If set then using random delay between [`AfterCastDelay`..`AfterCastMaxDelay`]<br>Blocks **CastingHandler**. | `0` |
| --- | --- | --- |

Some of these properties are optional and not required to be specified.

However you can create complex conditions and branches to suit the situation.

Important, the `AfterCast` prefixed conditions order as is its shows up the the table above.

e.g. - bare minimum for a spell which has castbar.
```json
{
    "Name": "Frostbolt",
    "Key": "1",
    "HasCastBar": true,   //<-- Must be indicated the spell has a castbar
}
```

e.g. - bare minimum for a spell which is instant (no castbar)
```json
{
    "Name": "Earth Shock",
    "Key": "6"
}
```

e.g. for Rogue ability
```json
{
    "Name": "Slice and Dice",
    "Key": "3",
    "Requirements": [
        "!Slice and Dice",
        "Combo Point > 1"
    ]
}
```

Theres are few specially named [KeyAction](#keyaction) such as `Food` and `Drink` which is reserved for eating and drinking.

They already have some pre baked [Requirement(s)](#requirement) conditions in order to avoid mistype the definition. 

The bare minimum for `Food` and `Drink` is looks something like this.
```json
{
    "Name": "Food",
    "Key": "-",
    "Requirement": "Health% < 50"
},
{
    "Name": "Drink",
    "Key": "=",
    "Requirement": "Mana% < 50"
}
```

When any of these [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) detected, by default, it going to be awaited with a predefined [Wait Goal](#wait-goals) logic.

Should see something like this, you can override any of the following values.

```json
"Wait": {
    "AutoGenerateWaitForFoodAndDrink": true,    // should generate 'Eating' and 'Drinking' KeyActions
    "FoodDrinkCost": 5,                         // can override the Cost of awaiting Eating and Drinking
    "Sequence": [
    {
        "Name": "Eating",
        "Cost": 5,                              // FoodDrinkCost
        "Requirement": "Food && Health% < 99"
    },
    {
        "Name": "Drinking",
        "Cost": 5,                              // FoodDrinkCost
        "Requirement": "Drink && Mana% < 99"
    },
    ]
},
```
---

### Casting Handler

**CastingHandler** is a component which responsible for handling player spell casting, 
let it be using an item from the inventory, casting an instant spell or casting a spell which has castbar.

From Addon version **1.6.0** it has been significantly changed to the point where it no longer blocks the execution until the castbar fully finishes, but rather gives back the control to the parent Goal such as [Adhoc Goals](#adhoc-goals) or [Pull Goal](#pull-goal) or [Combat Goal](#combat-goal) to give more time to find the best suitable action for the given moment.

As a result in order to execute the [Pull Goal](#pull-goal) sequence in respect, have to combine its [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) with `AfterCast` prefixed conditions.

---

## Goal Groups

### Pull Goal

This is the `Sequence` of [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) that are used when pulling a mob.

e.g.
```json
"Pull": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Concussive Shot",
            "Key": "9",
            "BeforeCastStop": true,
            "Requirements": [
                "HasRangedWeapon",
                "!InMeleeRange",
                "HasAmmo"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Assist Focus Goal

The `Sequence` of [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) that are used while the `AssistFocus` Mode is active. 

Upon any [keyAction's](#keyaction) [requirement](#requirement) are met, the **Assist Focus Goal** is become active.

Upon entering **Assist Focus Goal**, the player attempts to target the `focus`/`party1`.

Then as defined, in-order, executes those [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) which fulfills its given [requirement(s)](#requirement).

Upon exiting **Assist Focus Goal**, the current target will be deselected / cleared.

**Note**: You can use every [Buff](#buff--debuff--general-boolean-condition-requirements) and [Debuff](#buff--debuff--general-boolean-condition-requirements) names on the `focus`/`party1` without being targeted. Just have to prefix it with `F_` example: `F_Mark of the Wild` which means `focus`/`party1` has `Mark of the Wild` buff active.

e.g. of a Balance Druid
```json
"AssistFocus": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Mark of the Wild",
            "Key": "4",
            "Form": "None",
            "Requirements": [
                "!Mounted",
                "!F_Mark of the Wild",
                "SpellInRange:5"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Name": "Thorns",
            "Key": "7",
            "Form": "None",
            "Requirements": [
                "!Mounted",
                "!F_Thorns",
                "SpellInRange:8"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Name": "Regrowth",
            "Key": "0",
            "HasCastBar": true,
            "WhenUsable": true,
            "AfterCastAuraExpected": true,
            "Requirements": [
                "!Mounted",
                "!F_Regrowth",
                "FocusHealth% < 65",
                "SpellInRange:6"
            ],
            "Form": "None"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Rejuvenation",
            "Key": "6",
            "BeforeCastStop": true,
            "AfterCastWaitBuff": true,
            "Requirements": [
                "!Mounted",
                "!F_Rejuvenation",
                "FocusHealth% < 75",
                "SpellInRange:7"
            ],
            "Form": "None"
        }
    ]
},
```

### Combat Goal

The `Sequence` of [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) that are used when in combat and trying to kill a mob. 

The combat goal does the first available command on the list. 

The goal then runs again re-evaluating the list before choosing the first available command again, and so on until the mob is dead.

e.g.
```json
"Combat": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Fireball",
            "Key": "2",
            "HasCastBar": true,
            "Requirement": "TargetHealth% > 20"
        },
        {
            "Name": "AutoAttack",
            "Requirement": "!AutoAttacking"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Approach",
            "Log": false
        }
    ]
}
```

### Adhoc Goals

These `Sequence` of [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) are done when not in combat and are not on cooldown. Suitable for personal buffs.

e.g.
```json
"Adhoc": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Frost Armor",
            "Key": "3",
            "Requirement": "!Frost Armor"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Food",
            "Key": "=",
            "Requirement": "Health% < 30"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Drink",
            "Key": "-",
            "Requirement": "Mana% < 30"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note**: that the default combat requirement can be overridden.

e.g high level [Death Knight](./Json/class/DeathKnight_70_Unholy.json) 
```json
{
    "Cost": 3.1,
    "Name": "Horn of Winter",
    "Key": "F4",
    "InCombat": "i dont care",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": [
        "!Horn of Winter || (CD_Horn of Winter <= GCD && TargetAlive && TargetHostile)",
        "!Mounted"
    ]
},
```

e.g high level [Warlock](./Json/class/Warlock_66_Demo_pet_pull.json)
```json
{
    "Name": "Life Tap",
    "Cost": 3,
    "Key": "N9",
    "InCombat": "i dont care",
    "Charge": 2,
    "Requirements": [
        "!Casting",
        "Health% > TAP_MIN_MANA%",
        "Mana% < TAP_MIN_MANA%"
    ]
},
```


### Parallel Goals

These `Sequence` of [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) are done when not in combat and are not on cooldown. 

The key presses happens simultaneously on all [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) which meets the [Requirement(s)](#requirement).

Suitable for `Food` and `Drink`.

e.g.
```json
"Parallel": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Food",
            "Key": "=",
            "Requirement": "Health% < 50"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Drink",
            "Key": "-",
            "Requirement": "Mana% < 50"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Wait Goals

These actions cause to wait while the [Requirement(s)](#requirement) are met, during this time the player going to be idle, until lowered cost action can be executed.

e.g.
```json
"Wait": {
    "Sequence": [
    {
        "Cost": 19,
        "Name": "HP regen",
        "Requirements": [
            "FoodCount == 0 || !Usable:Food",
            "Health% < 90"
        ]
    }
    ]
},
```
---

### NPC Goals

These command are for vendoring and repair.

e.g.
```json
"NPC": {
    "Sequence": [
    {
        "Name": "Repair",
        "Key": "C",
        "Requirement": "Items Broken",
        "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
        "Cost": 6
    },
    {
        "Name": "Sell",
        "Key": "C",
        "Requirement": "BagFull",
        "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
        "Cost": 6
    }
    ]
}
```

The "Key" is a key that is bound to a macro. The macro needs to target the NPC, and if necessary open up the repair or vendor page. The bot will click the key and the npc will be targetted. Then it will click the interact button which will cause the bot to move to the NPC and open the NPC options, this may be enough to get the auto repair and auto sell greys to happen. But the bot will click the button again in case there are further steps (e.g. SelectGossipOption), or you have many greys or items to sell.

e.g. Sell macro - bound to the `"C"` key using BindPad or Key bindings
```lua
/tar Jannos Ironwill
/run DataToColor:sell({"Light Leather","Cheese","Light Feather"});
```

e.g. Repair macro
```lua
/tar Vargus
/script SelectGossipOption(1)
```

e.g. Delete various items
```lua
/run c=C_Container for b=0,4 do for s=1,c.GetContainerNumSlots(b) do local n=c.GetContainerItemLink(b,s) if n and (strfind(n,"Slimy") or strfind(n,"Pelt") or strfind(n,"Mystery")) then c.PickupContainerItem(b,s) DeleteCursorItem() end end end
```

Because some NPCs are hard to reach, there is the option to add a short path to them e.g. `"Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json"`. The idea is that the start of the path is easy to get to and is a short distance from the NPC, you record a path from the easy to reach spot to the NPC with a distance between spots of 1. When the bot needs to vend or repair it will path to the first spot in the list, then walk closely through the rest of the spots, once they are walked it will press the defined Key, then walk back through the path.

e.g. `Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json` in the `Json/path` folder looks like this:
```json
[{"X":51.477,"Y":29.347},{"X":51.486,"Y":29.308},{"X":51.495,"Y":29.266},{"X":51.503,"Y":29.23},{"X":51.513,"Y":29.186},{"X":51.522,"Y":29.147},{"X":51.531,"Y":29.104},{"X":51.54,"Y":29.063},{"X":51.551,"Y":29.017},{"X":51.559,"Y":28.974},{"X":51.568,"Y":28.93},{"X":51.578,"Y":28.889},{"X":51.587,"Y":28.853},{"X":51.597,"Y":28.808}]
```
If you have an NPC that is easy to get to such as the repair NPC in Arathi Highlands then the path only needs to have one spot in it. e.g.
```json
[{"X":45.8,"Y":46.6}]
```

Short Path Example:

### Repeatable Quests Handin

In theory if there is a repeatable quest to collect items, you could set up a NPC task as follows. See 'Bag requirements' for [Requirement(s)](#requirement) format.
```json
{
    "Name": "Handin",
    "Key": "K",
    "Requirements": ["BagItem:12622:5","BagItem:12623:5"],
    "PathFilename": "Path_to_NPC.json",
    "Cost": 6
}
```

### Follow Route Goal

Uses the [Path](#path) settings, follows the given route, uses pathfinding depending on the loaded [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration)s [Mode](#modes).

Basic informations
* Base cost 20.
* It can be added multiple times via the [Class Configuration.Paths](#12-class-configuration) property array.

Meanwhile attempts to
* find a new possible non blacklisted target
* find a possible gathering node

# Requirement

A requirement is something that must be evaluated to be `true` for the [KeyAction](#keyaction) to run. 

Not all [KeyAction](#keyaction) requires requirement(s), some rely on
* `Cooldown` - populated manually
* `ActionBarCooldownReader` - populated automatically
* `ActionBarCostReader` - populated automatically

Can specify `Requirements` for complex condition.

e.g.
```json
{
    "Name": "Execute",                                            //<--- Has no Requirement
    "Key": "7",
    "WhenUsable": true
},
{
    "Name": "Soul Shard",
    "Key": "9",
    "HasCastBar": true,
    "Requirements": ["TargetHealth% < 36", "!BagItem:6265:3"]     //<--- Requirement List
},
{
    "Name": "Curse of Weakness",
    "Key": "6",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirement": "!Curse of Weakness"                           //<--- Single Requirement
}
```

### **Negate a requirement**

Every requirement can be negated by adding one of the `Negate keyword` in front of the requirement.

Formula: `[Negate keyword][requirement]`

| Negate keyword |
| --- |
| `"not "` |
| `"!"` |

e.g.
```json
"Requirement": "not Curse of Weakness"
"Requirement": "!BagItem:Item_Soul_Shard:3"
```
---

### **And / Or multiple Requirements**

Two or more Requirement can be merged into a single Requirement object. 

By default every Requirement is concataneted with `[and]` operator which means in order to execute the [KeyAction](#keyaction), every member in the `RequirementsObject` must be evaluated to `true`. However this consctruct allows to concatanete with `[or]`. Nesting parenthesis are also supported.

Formula: `[Requirement1] [Operator] [RequirementN]`

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "&&" | And |
| "\|\|" | Or |

e.g.
```json
"Requirements": ["Has Pet", "TargetHealth% < 70 || TargetCastingSpell"]
"Requirement": "!Form:Druid_Bear && Health% < 50 || MobCount > 2",
"Requirement": "(Judgement of the Crusader && CD_Judgement <= GCD && TargetHealth% > 20) || TargetCastingSpell"
```
---

| MinRange | MaxRange | alias Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2 | "InCloseMeleeRange" |
| 0 | 5 | "InMeleeRange" |
| 5 | 15 | "IsInDeadZoneRange" |

Its worth mention that `CD_{KeyAction.Name}` is a dynamic value.<br>Each [KeyAction](#keyaction) has its own `in-game Cooldown` which is not the same as `KeyAction.Cooldown`!

e.g. Single Requirement
```json
"Requirement": "Health%>70"
"Requirement": "TargetHealth%<=10"
"Requirement": "PetHealth% < 10"
"Requirement": "Mana% <= 40"
"Requirement": "Mana < 420"
"Requirement": "Energy >= 40"
"Requirement": "Rage > 90"
"Requirement": "BagCount > 80"
"Requirement": "MobCount > 1"
"Requirement": "MinRange < 5"
"Requirement": "MinRange > 15"
"Requirement": "MaxRange > 20"
"Requirement": "MaxRange > 35"
"Requirement": "LastAutoShotMs <= 500"
"Requirement": "LastMainHandMs <= 500"
"Requirement": "CD_Judgement < GCD"                 // The remaining cooldown on Judgement is less then GCD(1500)
"Requirement": "CD_Hammer of Justice > CD_Judgement" // The remaining cooldown on Hammer of Justice is greater then 8 seconds
"Requirement": "Rage >= Cost_Heroic Strike"          // Create a condition like if player current rage is greater then or equal the cost of Heroic Strike
"Requirement": "MainHandSpeed > 3500"   // Main hand attack speed is greater then 3.5 seconds
"Requirement": "MainHandSwing > -400"   // 400 milliseconds before next predicted main swing happen
"Requirement": "MainHandSwing > -400"   // 400 milliseconds before next predicted main swing happen
"Requirement": "Dead && Deaths % 2"   // Player is currently dead and died for the second time in the current session
```

e.g. List of Requirements
```json
"Requirements": [
    "TargetHealth% > DOT_MIN_HEALTH%",  // where DOT_MIN_HEALTH% is a user defined variable
    "!Immolate"
],
```

e.g. for `CD`: It's a good idea to put `CD` in healing spells to take consideration of the spell interruption.
```json
{
    "Name": "Flash of Light",
    "Key": "6",
    "HasCastBar": true,
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": ["Health% < 60", "TargetHealth% > 20", "CD == 0", "MobCount < 2", "LastMainHandMs <= 1000"],
    "Cooldown": 6000
},
```

e.g. for `CD_{KeyAction.Name}`: Where `Hammer of Justice` referencing the `Judgement` **in-game** Cooldown to do an awesome combo!
```json
{
    "Name": "Judgement",
    "Key": "1",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": ["Seal of the Crusader", "!Judgement of the Crusader"]
},
{
    "Name": "Hammer of Justice",
    "Key": "7",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": ["Judgement of the Crusader && CD_Judgement <= GCD && TargetHealth% > 20 || TargetCastingSpell"]
}
```

---
### **Trigger requirements**

If you feel the current Requirement toolset is not enough for you, you can use other addons such as **WeakAura's** Trigger to control a given bit.

1. **The regarding in-game Addon API is looks like this**

    ```lua
    YOUR_CHOOSEN_ADDON_NAME_FROM_ADDON_CONFIG:Set(bit, value)
    -- bit: 0-23
    -- value: 0 or 1 or true or false

    --e.g. by using default addon name
    DataToColor:Set(0,1)
    DataToColor:Set(0,0)
    DataToColor:Set(23,true)
    DataToColor:Set(23,false)
    ```

    e.g. you can make your awesome WeakAura. Then you can put the following Addon API in the

    WeakAura -> Actions -> On Show -> Custom
    ```lua
    DataToColor:Set(0,1) -- enable Trigger 0
    ```

    WeakAura -> Actions -> On Hide -> Custom
    ```lua
    DataToColor:Set(0,0)  -- disable Trigger 0
    ```

    Example Weakaura for hunter pet in 10y range for feed pet
    ```lua

    ```

1. **Then outside of the game, you can specify the following in the [Class Configuration](#12-class-configuration) file ex. `class/Hunter_62.json`**

    Formula: `Trigger:[bit]:[name]`

    Where the `bit` is 0-23 and the `name` is a free text which shows up in the frontend.

    e.g.
    ```json
    "Requirement": "Trigger:0:Pet in range"           // Trigger 0 must be true
    "Requirement": "Trigger:23:My Awesome trigger"    // Trigger 23 must be true
    "Requirement": "not Trigger:6:Suppression"        // Trigger 6 must be false
    ```

### **SpellInRange requirements**

Allow requirements about spell range to be used, the spell in question depends upon the class being played.

`"SpellInRange:0"` or `"not SpellInRange:0"` for a Warrior is Charge and for a Mage is Fireball. 

This might be useful if you were close enough for a Fireball, but not for a Frostbolt.

Formula: `SpellInRange:[Numeric integer value/IntVariablesKey]`

### **Target Casting Spell requirement**

Combined with the `KeyAction.UseWhenTargetIsCasting` property, this requirement can limit on which enemy target spell your character will react or ignore.

Firstly `"TargetCastingSpell"` as it is without mentioning any spellID. Simply tells if the target is doing any cast at all.

Secondly can specify the following Format `"TargetCastingSpell:spellID1,spellID2,..."` which translates to "if Target is casting spellID1 OR spellID2 OR ...".

e.g. Rogue_20.json
```json
{
    "Name": "Kick",
    "UseWhenTargetIsCasting": true
},
{
    "Name": "Kick",
    "Requirement": "not TargetCastingSpell"
},
{
    "Name": "Kick",
    "UseWhenTargetIsCasting": true,
    "Requirement": "TargetCastingSpell:9053,11443"
},
{
    "Name": "Kick",
    "Requirement": "not TargetCastingSpell:11443"
}
```

# Interrupt Requirement

Every [KeyAction](#keyaction) has individual Interrupt(s) condition(s) which are [Requirement(s)](#requirement) to stop execution before fully finishing it.

As of now every [Goal groups](#goal-groups) has a default Interrupt.
* [Combat Goal](#combat-goal) based [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) interrupted once the target dies and the player loses the target.
* [Parallel Goal](#parallel-goals) based [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) has **No** interrupt conditions.
* [Adhoc Goals](#adhoc-goals) based [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) depends on `KeyAction.InCombat` flag.
* [Assist Focus Goal](#assist-focus-goal) based [KeyAction(s)](#keyaction) interrupted once the target dies and the player loses the target.

Here's and example for low level Hunters, while playing without a pet companion take advantage of interrupt.

It attempts to step back for a maximum **3000**ms duration however this can be interrupted either
* losing the current target
* the next Auto Shot coming in **500**ms

This **500**ms duration is the reload animation time, while the player has to stay still.

```json
"Combat": {
    "Sequence": [
        //...
        {
        "Name": "Stepback",
        "Key": "S",
        "PressDuration": 3000,
        "BaseAction": true,
        "Requirements": [
            "LastAutoShotMs < 400",
            "!InMeleeRange",
            "AutoShot"
        ],
        "Interrupt": "RangedSwing < -500 && TargetAlive"
        },
        //...
    ]
}
```

# Modes

The default mode for the bot is to grind, but there are other modes. The mode is set in the root of the class file.

e.g. Rogue.json
```json
{
    "PathFilename": "Herb_EPL.json",
    "Mode": "AttendedGather",
    "GatherFindKeys":  ["1","2"]
}
```

The available modes are:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"Grind"` | Default mode.<br>[Follows the Route](#follow-route-goal). Attempts to find Non-Blacklist targets to kill.<br>(*if enabled*) Attempts to `"Loot"` and GatherCorpse nearby corpses.<br>(*if exists*) Executes `"Adhoc"`, `"NPC"`, `"Parallel"`, `"Pull"`, `"Combat"`, `"Wait"` Sequences |
| `"AttendedGrind"` | Similair to `"Grind"`.<br>Navigation([Follow Route Goal](#follow-route-goal)) disabled.<br>The only difference is that **you** control the route, and select what target to kill. |
| `"CorpseRun"` | Relies on navigation. [Follows the Route](#follow-route-goal)<br>Runs back to the corpse after dies.<br>Can be useful if you are farming an instance and die, the bot will run you back some or all of the way to the instance entrance. |
| `"AttendedGather"` | Have to `Start Bot` under `Gather` tab and stay at `Gather` tab.<br>[Follows the Route](#follow-route-goal) and scan the minimap for the yellow nodes which indicate a herb or mining node.<br>Once one or more present, the navigation stops and alerts you by playing beeping sound!<br>**You** have to click at the herb/mine. In the `LogComponent` the necessary prompt going be shown to proceed.<br>**Important note**: `Falling` and `Jumping` means the same thing, if you lose the ground the bot going to take over the control! Be patient.<br>(*if exists*) Executes `"Adhoc"`, `"NPC"`, `"Parallel"`, `"Pull"`, `"Combat"`, `"Wait"` Sequences |
| `"AssistFocus"` | Navigation([Follow Route Goal](#follow-route-goal)) disabled.<br>Requires a friendly `focus` to exists. Follows the `focus` target.<br>Once a friendly `focustarget` in 11 yard range attempts to Interact with it.<br>Once a hostile `focustarget` in-combat exists, attempts to assist it (kill it).<br>After leaving combat, (*if enabled*) attempts to Loot and GatherCorpse nearby corpses.<br>Works inside Instances.<br>(*if exists*) Executes `"Adhoc"`, `"Parallel"`, `"Pull"`, `"AssistFocus"`, `"Combat"`, `"Wait"` Sequences.<br>**Note**: In Vanilla `focus` dosen't exists, so instead using `party1`. Party is **required**. |

# User Interface

## Other devices

The user interface is shown in a browser on port **5000** [http://192.168.0.19:5000](http://192.168.0.19:5000). This allows you to view it from another device on your lan.

To access you PC port **5000** from another device, you will need to open up port **5000** in your firewall.

## Components

The UI has the following components:

### Screenshot

**Note**: Due the high resource usage of the component, it does not updated all the time, only when a given **Core** component requires it.

![Screenshot Component](images/screenshotComponent.png)

### Player Summary

Show the player state. A hyper link to wowhead appears for the mob you are fighting so you can check out what it drops.

![Player Summary](images/PlayerSummary.png)

### Route

This component shows:

* The main path
* Your location
* The location of any deaths
* Pathed routes

![Route](images/Route.png)

Pathed routes are shown in Green.

![Pathed route](images/PathedRoute.png)

### Goal

This component contains a button to allow the bot to be enabled and disabled.

This displays the finite state machine. The state is goal which can run and has the highest priority. What determines if the goal can run are its pre-conditions such as having a target or being in combat. The executing goal is allowed to complete before the next goal is determined.

Some goals (combat,pull target) contain a list of spells which can be cast. The combat task evaluates its spells in order with the first available being cast. The goal then gives up control so that a higher priority task can take over (e.g. Healing potion).

The visualisation of the pre-conditions and spell [requirement(s)](#requirement) makes it easier to understand what the bot is doing and determine if the class file needs to be tweaked.

![Goals](images/actionsComponent.png)

# Recording a Path

Various path are needed by the bot:

The path to run when grinding (PathFilename in root of class files).
```json
"PathFilename": "16_LochModan.json",
"PathThereAndBack": true,
"PathReduceSteps": false,
```

The short path to get to the vendor/repairer when there are obstacles close to them (PathFilename withing NPC task):
```json
{
    "Name": "Sell",
    "Key": "C",
    "Requirement": "BagFull",
    "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
    "Cost": 6
}
```

## Recording a new path

To record a new path place your character where the start of the path should be, then click on the 'Record Path' option on the left hand side of the bot's browser window. Then click 'Record New'.

![New Path](images/Path_New.png)

Now walk the path the bot should take.

If you make a mistake you can remove spots by clicking on them on the list on the right. Then either enter new values for the spot or click 'Remove'.

For tricky parts you may want to record spots close together by using the 'Distance between spots' slider (Smaller number equals closer together).

Once the path is complete click 'Save'. This path will be saved with a generic filename e.g. `Path_20201108112650.json`, you will need to go into your `/Json/path` and rename it to something sensible.

![Recording Path](images/Path_Recording.png)

## Types of paths

### There and back 

```json
"PathThereAndBack": true
```

These paths are run from one end to the other and then walked backwards back to the start. So the end does not need to be near the start.

![There and back path](images/Path_Thereandback.png)

### Joined up

```json
"PathThereAndBack": false
```

These paths are run from one end to the other and then repeated. So the path needs to join up with itself i.e. the end needs to be near the start.

![Circular path](images/Path_Circular.png)

## Tips  

Try to avoid the path getting too close to:

* Obstactles like trees, houses.
* Steep hills or cliffs (falling off one can make the bot get stuck).
* Camps/groups of mobs.
* Elite mob areas, or solo elite paths.

The best places to grind are:

* Places with non casters i.e. beasts. So that they come to you when agro'd.
* Places where mobs are far apart (so you don't get adds).
* Places with few obstacles.
* Flat ground.


# V1 Remote Pathing - PathingAPI

Pathing is built into the bot so you don't need to do anything special except download the MPQ files. You can though run it on its own server to visualise routes as they are created by the bot, or to play with route finding.

The bot will try to calculate a path in the following situations:

* Travelling to a vendor or repair.
* Doing a corpse run.
* Resuming the grind path at startup, after killing a mob, or if the distance to the next stop in the path is not a short distance.

## Video:

[![Pathing Video Youtube](images/PathingApi.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz_jFZfxSdc&t=254s&ab_channel=JulianPerrott)

## Running on its own server.

In visual studio just set PathingAPI as the startup project or from the command line:

```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\PathingAPI
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

Then in a browser go to http://192.168.0.19:5001

There are 3 pages:

* Watch API Calls
* Search
* Route
* Swagger

Requests to the API can be done in a new browser tab like this or via the Swagger tab. You can then view the result in the Watch API calls viewer.

```
http://192.168.0.19:5001/api/PPather/MapRoute?map1=1446&x1=51.0&y1=29.3&map2=1446&x2=38.7&y2=20.1
```

Search gives some predefined locations to search from and to.

## Running it along side the bot

In visual studio right click the solution and set Multiple startup projects to BlazorServer and PathingApi and run.

Or from 2 command lines `dotnet run` each.

```ps
cd c:\WowClassicGrindBot\PathingAPI
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

```ps
cd c:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## As a library used within the bot

The bot will use the PathingAPI to work out routes, these are shown on the route map as green points.
